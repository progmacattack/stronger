- When logged in user saves routine, cycle number and week number are now passed in and saved to db

- When any user saves routine, cycle number and week number are now passed in and saved to db
- Repetitions not being updated/saved is fixed
- Removed 'current users' link
- Made assign random username/password an AJAX request

- Created endpoint to update navigation bar after account creation, implemented in JS
- Logout returns home
- Added login to home page

Problems:
- Initial save with random user does not save cycle week ---- cannot replicate

Ideas:
- Make front end look better
- Show 'My routine' link after initial save
